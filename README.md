# Indian-IPOs-Project
EDA and ML Project on Indian IPOs 2010-21

A few months back when I was just starting my Data Science journey, I came across this insightful dataset on Kaggle which had a compilation of IPOs which happened in the Indian Stock Market from the year 2010-21. Although the dataset is incomplete as there would have been many more IPOs in the same period, I still decided to explore it as I wanted to understand it. 

I started off with Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset where I leveraged the plotting capabilities of R and got some plots which painted a vivid picture in my viewpoint.

Now, when I switched off to Python, I wondered whether we can predict the listing profitability and current profitability of an IPO using the subscription status, issue size, listing gains, etc. indicative of quantitative aspect of the dataset (not exhaustive as there are lots of key factors involved in predicting the profitability). So, I decided to leverage the basic ML capabilities of Python as I was unable to discover a notebook on Kaggle which explored this aspect of the aforementioned dataset.

It was altogether a wonderful learning experience where I got to learn many things while exploring this dataset and it has set me on a never-ending journey of exploring the unpredictable Stock Market.

Thanks for reading!
